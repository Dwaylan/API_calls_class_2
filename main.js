// method we are saying that when we retrieve our data we are PROMISING to do something
// with it. We are asking our program to fetch pokemon data from the pokeapi.

// but the promise has been made

// ***Comprehension check: What is json? json, or JavaScript Object Notation is what FORMATS information
// from the server to the webpage in a way that is readable for JavaScript. If API is the means of how we
// request things from the server, then json is what makes that data from our server readable to JS***

// If the code above is our link or passageway, then the code below is our vehicle
// to get information from the JS to the HTML

// Now it's time to access the inner text of the name drive and place our pokemon
// names there
        name.innerText = pokeNames;

// *** Recap: 1.) Created an element called name. 2.) Appended that elemennt to the HTML
// 3.) Created a variable called pokeNames to acces the pokemon names.
// 4.) placed our pokeNames variable in the inner text of our name element.

// Now we are going to give the button a purpose. First we are going to grab our
// pokePromise which initializes the fetching from our API
