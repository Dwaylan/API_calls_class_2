// but the promise has been made

// ***Comprehension check: What is json? json, or JavaScript Object Notation is what FORMATS information

// *** Recap: 1.) Created an element called name. 2.) Appended that elemennt to the HTML
// 3.) Created a variable called pokeNames to acces the pokemon names.
// 4.) placed our pokeNames variable in the inner text of our name element.

// Now we are going to give the button a purpose. First we are going to grab our
// pokePromise which initializes the fetching from our API
